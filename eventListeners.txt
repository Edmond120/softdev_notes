Event Propagation:
	1. An element intercepts an event
	2. Browser collects DOM node path of the event from the starting element to the root
	3. Capture: The event propagates down the path from step 2
	4. Bubble: The event propagates up the path from step 2

	By default, event listeners do not trigger until the even bubble phase.

	Triggering events at the capture phase can be done by zadding true as a thild argument
	to addEventListener
	```
		x.addEventListener("click", foo, true)
	```
	You can cancel event propagation
	```
