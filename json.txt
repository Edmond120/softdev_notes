JSON:
	JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation

	They are storied much like python dictionaries, but are called associative arrays
	but I will be calling them dictionaries because it makes things easier

	Examples:
		```
		var o = {
			x: 4,
			y: 16,

			print: function(){
				console.log(this.x + ' ' + this.y)
			},
		};
		```
		note that in the function, this refers to the dictionary

		```
		var newObj = function(x, y) {
			var obj = {
				x: x,
				y: y,

				print: function(){
					console.log(this.x + ' ' + this.y)
				},
			};
		};
		```
