	Sessions

		Flask sessions are securely signed cookies.

		The session object works excatly like a dictionary

			Add data to a session:
				session[KEY] = DATA

			Remove data from a session:
				session.pop(KEY)

	You have to import session from flask
		to encrypt a session, you need a secret key.
			ex. app.secret_key = "secret word"

	os.urandom(64) - gives you a string of 64 random chars
