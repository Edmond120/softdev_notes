XML:
	eXtensible Markup Language

	It is not a formatting language (like HTML)

	A framework for creating markup based grammars

	Uses some of the syntactic standards of HTML, like tags and attributes,
	with a focus on storing and representing data instead of rendering and
	displaying it.

	An XML namespace is defined by the tags and attributes associated with
	specific XML language.
