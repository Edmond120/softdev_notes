Canvasing the Area

HTML5

	Redesign of HTML with a focus on making the more "modern" features of web 
	browsers easy to work with

	Designed around javascript and a standarized DOM

	Includes built in support for audio and video playback.

		<audio> and <video>
	
	Canvas

		HTML5 element that provides a drawing area.

		Javascript functions can draw onto a canvas element.
			
			You must declare in what context you are drawing in
			ex. 2d,3d, raw bitmap rendering

			ex. canvas.getContext("2d")

		Basic canvas operation

		HTML
	
			<canvas height="500" width="500" id="slate">

				Any text there is only displayed if the canvas element is not
				recognized by the browser.

			</canvas>
javascript path functions

	Paths are used to draw arbitrrary shapes, including circles and curves

	The path is a property of the context, so there can only be one path at a time.

	<context>.beginPath() starts a new path.

	stroke() draws lines between the points in the current path.

	arc
		Function that adds the points along an arc to the current path.

		<context>.arc(x, y, rc, start, end)

		Draw an arc of a circle from start to end (in radians), with center(x,y)
		and radius r.

	ex. draw circle
		ctx.arc(250,250,150,0,2 * Math.PI);
		ctx.stroke();
		//add color
		ctx.fill();

	clearRect
		Function that clears the area in the rectangle
		
		<context>.clearRect(x,y,width,height);
