Callback function

	Function that is passed as an argument to another function and intended 
	to run at a specified moment (either due to an event or a timer).

	When passing a callback as an argument, you should not call the function.
	
	Used extensively in javascript.

ELEMENT.addEventListener(<EVENT>,<CALLBACK>)
	
	The callback function should take a single parameter taht will represent the 
	triggering event when called.
