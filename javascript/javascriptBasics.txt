oVariable basics

	All variables must be declared before being used.

	All numbers are doubles.
	
	var x = 4;
	
	var b = true;

	var s = "hello";
		
	var s = 'hello';

	var l = [4,3,19]

	var o = { 'a' : 10, 'x' : 'hello' };

	
Javascript functions
	javasscript is functional. Like scheme (Racket)!

	Functions are first class objects that can be used like any other value
