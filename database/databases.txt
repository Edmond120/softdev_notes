NoSQL Databases:
	Non table-based (relational) databases.

	Relational databases (perhaps not SQL based) are the most commonly used,
	but NoSQL have become more popular with the advancement of the 21st century web 
	applications and big data.

	Examples:
		Key-Value: Database is essentially a large dictionary.
	
	Graph: Database is stored as a graph, where relationships between the data nodes
		are essential to the database schema.

	Document: Database is a collection of documents, which can contain various amounts
		and types of data.
		
		A single record in a document database is a document.

		Documents contain fields and values (like a dictionary)

		You do not need to specify types for the values.

		A group of documents is put into a collection.

		Documents do not need to be stored on the same storage device.
