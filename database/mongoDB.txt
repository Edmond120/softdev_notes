MongoDB:
	-Uses a separate database server
	-mongod server process runs on one machine
	-mongo client processes run on several machines & can w/ server
	-Libraries for languages to communicate w/mongo (pymongo)
	-camelCase

Using the Mongo Shell:
	Connecting:
		$ mongo <server>

		server should be an IP address.

	Shell Commands:
		db:
			shows what db you are in
		show dbs:
			shows the dbs and their sizes
		show collections:
			shows the collections in the db
		use <x>:
			"cd" into x
		
	Inserting a document:
		db.<collection>.insert(document)

		Add document to <collection>. Will create <collection> if it doesn't exist.
		
	Removing a collection:
		db.<collection>.drop()
	
	Removing a database:
		db.dropDatabase()

		removes the current database

	Querying MongoDB:
		db.<collection>.find( query document )

		  query documents define a database query

		    { query key : desired value }

		  This query documents can find all values where name is 'bob'

		    { 'name' : 'bob' }

		Comparison operators:
			Comparison operators are dictionaries that modify the value of the query
			document.

			  < → $lt, <= → $lte, > → $gt, >= → $gte, != → $ne, = → $eq

			  { "id" : {$lt : 400} }

		Logical operators:
			$and
			$not
			$or
			$nor
			
			Joins comparison operation dictionaries

			{$and : [ query document, another query document ] }
