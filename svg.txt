SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):

	SVG is a specific XML based vector graphics format.

	Vector graphics are images that are not represented as a 2d grid of pixels (raster)
	but instead as a list of drawing commands (like line, circle, rectangle, curve, ...)

<svg> element:
	The <svg> element is designed to store SVG code (that is, SVG XML elements)
	```
	<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="500" height="500">

		SVG CODE HERE
	
	</svg>
	```
	xmlns is just the namespace, IT IS NOT A LINK, the name could be anything
