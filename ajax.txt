AJAX
	
	Asynchronous Javascript And Xml

	System created to send data to a server in the background of a page without having
	to reload the page or wait for the server to acknowledge the change.

	It is a combination of technology including javascript, html,DOM and XML.

	AJAX calls can send data to s server using GET or POST, and then catch the data
	sent by the server when it eventually responds (asynchronous).

	Originally, XML was the only supported ormat for sending/receiving data, but now
	many formats are used, including JSON and plain text.

	AJAX calls can be made via the XMLHttpRequest javascript object

Using jquery for AJAX

	jquery is a javascript library that provides many wrappers for common javascript
	actions.

	Either download jquery or link to it via CDN in the <head> section of your html

	$ is the symbol used to refer to the jquery library in code.
